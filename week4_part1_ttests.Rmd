```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## 1. Confidence intervals

```{r}
otter_length <- c(38, 41, 50, 27, 48, 35, 62, 41, 33)

t.test(otter_length)

```

## 2. T-tests(1-sample t-test)

See a claim: mean otter length is 50 inches

```{r}
otter_test <- t.test(x = otter_length, mu = 50)
otter_test
```

## 3. Two-sample t-test

```{r}
desert_bighorns <- c(32, 24, 18, 26, 28, 49, 50, 20)
sierra_bighorns <- c(40, 53, 23, 19, 26, 29, 36)

t.test(x = desert_bighorns, y = sierra_bighorns)
```
